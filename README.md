This is a computer based Break Timer program to remind you to take regular breaks while working on your desk for good health. Some of us spend at least sixty per cent (if not more) of our day sitting on a chair working on a computer or for some other work. This physical inactivity for such long durations causes diseases like varicose veins, weak bones, back problems, weak digestion and can even increase the risk of cancer. Doctors around the world suggest good posture while sitting and taking regular breaks from your work. You can walk around and stretch a little bit for a healthy life.

Here is what the code does. Once you run it on your computer or any shell, it reminds you to take a break after a predetermined time through an audio announcement. It also randomly selects a video from a list (already fed in the program) and plays it to further motivate you to leave the desk and move around.
